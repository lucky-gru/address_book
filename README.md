# Simple Address Book

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

1. Please change .env.example to .env
2. Make sure to run API wrapper. 
   GetAddress.io doesn't allow CORS so this project needs an API wrapper.
   The repo is [GetAddress.io API](https://github.com/lucky-gru/getaddressio_api_wrapper).
3. After that, you need to specify the API wrapper to get addresses from getaddress.io
   for example REACT_APP_API='http://localhost:1337'
